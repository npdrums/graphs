# Graphs

Graphs, Digraphs and Edge Weighted Graphs with various algorithms. All written in JAVA. Thanks to all anonymus colleagues who provided their implementation which was used in some of these classes.

### NOTICE:
Some of the implementations are wildly influenced by implementations from https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/

The implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm uses IndexMinPQ class form the library that can be found on the link given above, so you have to include it in your project path.
